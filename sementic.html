          Shaniwar Wada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune, India. Built in 1732,[1] it was the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Confederacy until 1818. The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.[2]
